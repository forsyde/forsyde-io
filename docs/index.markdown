Welcome to ForSyDe IO's documentation page. 
Here you can find some quick links to help you navigate the documentation
and also to situate you about the tool and its methods.

<!-- ### 3) I am both a developer and a designer and want to extend the models themselves!

Well-met! Then you can checkout [Concepts]({{ site.baseurl }}/concept) to see how the
supporting libraries are generated for different languages based on the underlying model and contribute there!

Unless you'd like to test out just reading to memory and dumping to disk.
This subproject is intended to be consumed by tools and tool "vendors", 
or tool developers, so that [different steps of the design flow]({{ site.projects.forsyde }}#our-vision) can share a common model. 


If you're using other [ForSyDe]({{ site.projects.forsyde }}) tools like [IDeSyDe]({{ site.projects.idesyde}}), you're already benefiting from ForSyDe IO! -->
